# Hi there

This is Ryan ([@derbalkon](https://github.com/derbalkon)).

The photo above was taken when I was in my third year at med school, and it's called *Modern and Broken*, when the new building was just taking shape, next to the ruins.

I took this photo simply out of the thought of documenting the mess, as with everything else in the world.

## About this blog

This blog is built based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

The theme originates from jimmycai's [stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) and barely touched anything.

## You can find me

On GitHub, Twitter, Telegram and even Battle.net, where my usernames are mostly like `derbalkon`, `wrrrr` or `balconydesu`.

Yeah, they are all me.
